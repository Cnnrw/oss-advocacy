## Open-Source is for suckers

This is a sentiment held by many developers given the current state of
affairs. When the open-source movement began to take off in the early 90s
it was seen as a revolutionary force that could undermine entrenched tech
monopolies and democratize the economic potential of the early Internet.
However, 30 years later what we have are platforms built on a foundation of
open-source software that generate vast sums of wealth for a few
large companies. At hand are two issues; the first is the hoarding of the wealth
generated by platforms that rely on open-source software by large companies;
the second is the licensing fees for use of those platforms being so high
they effectively price out access in developing countries.

The digital divide is the gap in equitable access to technology that has
developed between developed and developing countries. This has important
implications for access to economic opportunities and growth developed
countries have enjoyed during the digital revolution.

Open-source software (OSS) is software with source code anyone can inspect,
modify, duplicate, or enhance. The movement is sustained by developers working
asynchronously on large projects governed by community consensus.

The [Open-Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd),
established in 1998, define ten criteria projects must meet to be
considered open-source. 1, 3, 6, 9

### 1. _Free Redistribution_
The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the
software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing
programs from different sources.

### 2. Source Code
The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source
code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not
distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of
obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost,
preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code
must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program.
Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such
as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.

### 3. _Derived Works_
The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them
to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.

### 4. Integrity of the Author's Source Code
The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified
form _only_ if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with
the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The
license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified
source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different
name or version number from the original software.

### 5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

### 6. _No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor_
The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a
specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program
from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

### 7. Distribution of License
The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is
redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those
parties.

### 8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part
of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that
distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license,
all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as
those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.

### 9. _License Must Not Restrict Other Software_
The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed
along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that
all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.

### 10. License Must be Technology-Neutral
No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology
or style of interface.
