### Reinvest in the Open-Source Community
The OSS community is not an extraction colony. Free software isn't free
to those who create, maintain, and manage it. Put resources back
into the open-source community by paying for commercial use or having some
of your developers contribute to the project.


### Licensing Fees
Lower software licensing fees would allow developing countries to
participate in the expanding digital economy. When the price of software is
the same in sub-Saharan Africa as it is in America you codify exclusion in
service of profit. Pricing proportionately to a country's GDP per capita,
for example, would increase elasticity and allow you to capture a larger
share of the market.

### From Open-Source to Freemium
Because the criteria for open-source software are easy to abuse,
it's time to consider moving from open-source to radical-freemium.

Freemium software typically offers basic functionality for free, and allows
users to "unlock" additional or advanced features by paying a fee. By
calling for radical-freemium, a project should be kept open-source and free
for all... except large companies. From a user's perspective the value proposition of
OSS remain the same, while you receive payment for its use in commercial
software.

### Licensing

As much as it pains us, we need to start reading the terms of service so to
speak. There are many kinds of licenses out there for use in open-source
projects, but it's not enough to just pick one at random and assume you'll
fine. The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/category)
has a great list of popularly chosen ones.

There are others out there, however, and it's worth looking for them. The
SSPL, created by MongoDB, allows for free use of, distribution,
 and modifications by most users. But for commercial use they'll have to get
a license from you.
