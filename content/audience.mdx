This is a call to action for software developers. Writing, managing, and
maintaining the foundations of the modern Internet while large companies
enjoy financial gains generated by that labor is no longer tenable. Issues
regarding the digital divide can no longer go unaddressed; equitable
Internet access has become a dependency of economic opportunity. We need to
add fair and equal access to the list of first principles guiding the future
of the industry.


## Responsibility To Others
The topic of this advocacy project is broad in scope and contains many nuanced
issues meaning I speak for one group or another throughout. It's difficult
advocating for two groups of people, those in the developing world and
software developers, that couldn't be further apart economically,
culturally, and geographically. Being a part of the latter group, I recognize
I come from a place of immense privilege.
